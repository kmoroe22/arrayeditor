     * Coding exercise : Array Editor
     *
     * Problem:
     * You're creating a program that is going to perform operations on a given array, Your program is going to be used as part of a larger project, but should still be able to be run on its own.
     * The operations that your program needs to be able to support are:
     *
     * Replace: Replace all instances of one value with another
     * Crop: Change the size of the array (for example, if the input array is 100 elements, crop it so that the output is only elements 10 to 20: the size of the output array is 10)
     * Fill: Similar to replace: Starting at a given index in an array, replace adjacent elements if their value is the same (similar to the "paint bucket" fill tool in image editing software)
     *
     *  For example, given the array:
     *  [0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1],
     *  and filling position 4 with the value "7", the result would be
     *   [0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 2, 2, 1]
     *
     * Smooth: replace values smaller than a minimum and larger with a maximum with the average of their neighbours.
     *  For example, given
     *  [40, 5, 200, 15],
     *  and smoothing with min 0 and max 100, the result would be
     *  [40, 5, 10, 15]
     *
     * For some extra fun (these are completely optional):
     *
     * Blur: Replace every value with the average of itself, and its two neighbours
     *
     * Edge detection: Detect places where the values in the array change.
     *
     *  For example, given
     *  [5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
     *  and performing edge detection, the result could be
     *  [ 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
     *
     *
     * Things to keep in mind:
     *
     * Think about how your program is going to accept input and provide output. Remember that it will be used in a larger project, but must be able to be run by itself
     * Remember to keep OO design principles in mind
     * What about edge cases? What happens if the input changes (for example, if the arrays were 2-dimensional)?
     * How would you test your program?
